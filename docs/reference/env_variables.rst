HIP environment variables
*************************************************************

In this section, the reader can find all the important HIP environment variables on AMD platform, which are grouped by functionality. The full collection of the ROCm environment variables, which are grouped by projects is on the :doc:`ROCm environment variables page <rocm:reference/env-variables>`.

GPU isolation variables
=======================

The GPU isolation environment variables in HIP are collected in the next table. For more information, check :doc:`GPU isolation page <rocm:conceptual/gpu-isolation>`.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 70,30

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Value**

    * - | ``ROCR_VISIBLE_DEVICES``
        | A list of device indices or UUIDs that will be exposed to applications.
      - Example: ``0,GPU-DEADBEEFDEADBEEF``

    * - | ``GPU_DEVICE_ORDINAL``
        | Devices indices exposed to OpenCL and HIP applications.
      - Example: ``0,2``

    * - | ``HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`` or ``CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES``
        | Device indices exposed to HIP applications.
      - Example: ``0,2``

Profiling variables
===================

The profiling environment variables in HIP are collected in the next table. For more information, check :doc:`setting the number of CUs page <rocm:how-to/setting-cus>`.

.. list-table::
    :header-rows: 1
    :widths: 70,30

    * - **Environment variable**
      - **Value**

    * - | ``HSA_CU_MASK``
        | Sets the mask on a lower level of queue creation in the driver,
        | this mask will also be set for queues being profiled.
      - Example: ``1:0-8``

    * - | ``ROC_GLOBAL_CU_MASK``
        | Sets the mask on queues created by the HIP or the OpenCL runtimes,
        | this mask will also be set for queues being profiled.
      - Example: ``0xf``, enables only 4 CUs

    * - | ``HIP_FORCE_QUEUE_PROFILING``
        | Used to run the app as if it were run in rocprof. Forces command queue
        | profiling on by default.
      - | 0: Disable
        | 1: Enable

Debug variables
===============

The debugging environment variables in HIP are collected in the next table. For more information, check :ref:`debugging_with_hip`.
