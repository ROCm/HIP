# Prerequisites

HIP code can be developed either on AMD ROCm platform using HIP-Clang compiler, or a CUDA platform with nvcc installed.
Before build and run HIP, make sure drivers and pre-build packages are installed properly on the platform.

## AMD platform
Install ROCm packages (see ROCm Installation Guide on AMD public documentation site (https://docs.amd.com/)) or install pre-built binary packages using the package manager,

```
sudo apt install mesa-common-dev
sudo apt install clang
sudo apt install comgr
sudo apt-get -y install rocm-dkms
```

## NVIDIA platform

Install Nvidia driver and pre-build packages (see HIP Installation Guide at https://docs.amd.com/ for the release)

## Branch of repository

Before get HIP source code, set the expected branch of repository at the variable HIP_BRANCH.
For example, for ROCm5.0 release branch, set
```
export HIP_BRANCH=rocm-5.0.x
```

ROCm5.1 release branch, set
```
export HIP_BRANCH=rocm-5.1.x
```
Similiar format for future branches.

ROCM_PATH is path where ROCM is installed. BY default ROCM_PATH is at /opt/rocm.


# Build HIP on AMD platform


## Get HIP source code

```
git clone -b $HIP_BRANCH https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hipamd.git
git clone -b $HIP_BRANCH https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hip.git
git clone -b $HIP_BRANCH https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/ROCclr.git
```

## Set the environment variables

```
export HIPAMD_DIR="$(readlink -f hipamd)"
export HIP_DIR="$(readlink -f hip)"
```

ROCclr is defined on AMD platform that HIP use Radeon Open Compute Common Language Runtime (ROCclr), which is a virtual device interface that HIP runtimes interact with different backends.
See https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/ROCclr

HIPAMD repository provides implementation specifically for AMD platform.
See https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hipamd

## Build HIP

```
cd "$HIPAMD_DIR"
mkdir -p build; cd build
cmake -DHIP_COMMON_DIR=$HIP_DIR -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<ROCM_PATH>/" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/install ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

Note: If you don't specify CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, hip runtime will be installed to "<ROCM_PATH>/hip".
By default, release version of AMDHIP is built.

## Default paths and environment variables

   * By default HIP looks for HSA in <ROCM_PATH>/hsa (can be overridden by setting HSA_PATH environment variable).
   * By default HIP is installed into <ROCM_PATH>/hip (can be overridden by setting HIP_PATH environment variable).
   * By default HIP looks for clang in <ROCM_PATH>/llvm/bin (can be overridden by setting HIP_CLANG_PATH environment variable)
   * By default HIP looks for device library in <ROCM_PATH>/lib (can be overridden by setting DEVICE_LIB_PATH environment variable).
   * Optionally, consider adding <ROCM_PATH>/bin to your PATH to make it easier to use the tools.
   * Optionally, set HIPCC_VERBOSE=7 to output the command line for compilation.

After make install command, make sure HIP_PATH is pointed to $PWD/install/hip.

## Build HIP tests

### Build HIP directed tests
Developers can build HIP directed tests right after build HIP commands,

```
sudo make install
make -j$(nproc) build_tests
```
By default, all HIP directed tests will be built and generated under the folder $HIPAMD_DIR/build/directed_tests.
Take HIP directed device APIs tests, as an example, all available test applications will have executable files generated under,
$HIPAMD_DIR/build/directed_tests/runtimeApi/device.

Run all HIP directed_tests, use the command,

```
ctest
```
Or
```
make test
```

Build and run a single directed test, use the follow command as an example,

```
make directed_tests.texture.hipTexObjPitch
cd $HIPAMD_DIR/build/directed_tests/texcture
./hipTexObjPitch
```
Please note, the integrated HIP directed tests, will be deprecated in future release.


### Build HIP catch tests

After build and install HIP commands, catch tests can be built via the following instructions,

```
cd "$HIP_DIR"
mkdir -p build; cd build
export HIP_PATH=$HIPAMD_DIR/build
cmake  ../tests/catch/ -DHIP_PLATFORM=amd
make -j$(nproc) build_tests
ctest # run tests
```

HIP catch tests are built under the folder $HIP_DIR/build.

To run a single catch test, the following is an example,

```
cd $HIP_DIR/build/unit/texture
./TextureTest
```

### Build HIP Catch2 standalone test

HIP Catch2 supports build a standalone test, for example,

```
export PATH=$HIP_DIR/bin:$PATH
export HIP_PATH=$HIPAMD_DIR/build/install

hipcc $HIP_DIR/tests/catch/unit/memory/hipPointerGetAttributes.cc -I ./tests/catch/include ./tests/catch/hipTestMain/standalone_main.cc -I ./tests/catch/external/Catch2 -g -o hipPointerGetAttributes
./hipPointerGetAttributes
...

All tests passed
```

HIP catch tests, especially new architectured Catch2, will be official HIP tests in the repository and can be built alone as with the instructions shown above.

# Build HIP on NVIDIA platform


## Get HIP source code

```
git clone -b $HIP_BRANCH https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hip.git
git clone -b $HIP_BRANCH https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hipamd.git
```

## Set the environment variables

```
export HIP_DIR="$(readlink -f hip)"
export HIPAMD_DIR="$(readlink -f hipamd)"
```

## Build HIP

```
cd "$HIPAMD_DIR"
mkdir -p build; cd build
cmake -DHIP_COMMON_DIR=$HIP_DIR -DHIP_PLATFORM=nvidia -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/install ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

## Build HIP tests
Build HIP tests commands on NVIDIA platform are basically the same as AMD, except set -DHIP_PLATFORM=nvidia.

# Run HIP

Compile and run the [square sample](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/tree/rocm-5.0.x/samples/0_Intro/square).
