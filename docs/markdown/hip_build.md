# Prerequisites

HIP code can be developed either on AMD ROCm platform using HIP-Clang compiler, or a CUDA platform with nvcc installed.
Before build and run HIP, make sure drivers and pre-build packages are installed properly on the platform.

## AMD platform
Install ROCm packages (see ROCm Installation Guide on AMD public documentation site (https://docs.amd.com/)) or install pre-built binary packages using the package manager,

```
sudo apt install mesa-common-dev
sudo apt install clang
sudo apt install comgr
sudo apt-get -y install rocm-dkms
```

## NVIDIA platform

Install Nvidia driver and pre-build packages (see HIP Installation Guide at https://docs.amd.com/ for the release)

## Branch of repository

Before get HIP source code, set the expected branch of repository at the variable ROCM_BRANCH.
For example, for ROCm5.0 release branch, set
```
export ROCM_BRANCH=rocm-5.0.x
```

ROCm5.4 release branch, set
```
export ROCM_BRANCH=rocm-5.4.x
```
Similiar format for future branches.

ROCM_PATH is path where ROCM is installed. BY default ROCM_PATH is at /opt/rocm.


# Build HIP on AMD platform


## Get HIP source code

```
git clone -b "$ROCM_BRANCH" https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hipamd.git
git clone -b "$ROCM_BRANCH" https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hip.git
git clone -b "$ROCM_BRANCH" https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/ROCclr.git
git clone -b "$ROCM_BRANCH" https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm-OpenCL-Runtime.git
```

## Set the environment variables

```
export HIPAMD_DIR="$(readlink -f hipamd)"
export HIP_DIR="$(readlink -f hip)"
```

ROCclr is defined on AMD platform that HIP use Radeon Open Compute Common Language Runtime (ROCclr), which is a virtual device interface that HIP runtimes interact with different backends.
See https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/ROCclr

HIPAMD repository provides implementation specifically for AMD platform.
See https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hipamd

## Build HIP

```
cd "$HIPAMD_DIR"
mkdir -p build; cd build
cmake -DHIP_COMMON_DIR=$HIP_DIR -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<ROCM_PATH>/" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/install ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

Note: If you don't specify CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, hip runtime will be installed to "<ROCM_PATH>/hip".
By default, release version of AMDHIP is built.

## Default paths and environment variables

   * By default HIP looks for HSA in <ROCM_PATH>/hsa (can be overridden by setting HSA_PATH environment variable).
   * By default HIP is installed into <ROCM_PATH>/hip (can be overridden by setting HIP_PATH environment variable).
   * By default HIP looks for clang in <ROCM_PATH>/llvm/bin (can be overridden by setting HIP_CLANG_PATH environment variable)
   * By default HIP looks for device library in <ROCM_PATH>/lib (can be overridden by setting DEVICE_LIB_PATH environment variable).
   * Optionally, consider adding <ROCM_PATH>/bin to your PATH to make it easier to use the tools.
   * Optionally, set HIPCC_VERBOSE=7 to output the command line for compilation.

After make install command, make sure HIP_PATH is pointed to $PWD/install/hip.

## Generating profiling header after adding/changing a HIP API

When you add or change a HIP API, you might need to generate a new `hip_prof_str.h` header. This header is used by rocm tools to track HIP APIs like rocprofiler/roctracer etc.
To generate the header after your change, use the tool `hip_prof_gen.py` present in `hipamd/src`.

Usage:

`hip_prof_gen.py [-v] <input HIP API .h file> <patched srcs path> <previous output> [<output>]`

Flags:

  * -v - verbose messages
  * -r - process source directory recursively
  * -t - API types matching check
  * --priv - private API check
  * -e - on error exit mode
  * -p - HIP_INIT_API macro patching mode

Example Usage: `hip_prof_gen.py -v -p -t --priv <hip>/include/hip/hip_runtime_api.h <hipamd>/src <hipamd>/include/hip/amd_detail/hip_prof_str.h <hipamd>/include/hip/amd_detail/hip_prof_str.h.new`

## Build HIP tests

### Build HIP directed tests
Developers can build HIP directed tests right after build HIP commands,

```
sudo make install
make -j$(nproc) build_tests
```
By default, all HIP directed tests will be built and generated under the folder $HIPAMD_DIR/build/directed_tests.
Take HIP directed device APIs tests, as an example, all available test applications will have executable files generated under,
$HIPAMD_DIR/build/directed_tests/runtimeApi/device.

Run all HIP directed_tests, use the command,

```
ctest
```
Or
```
make test
```

Build and run a single directed test, use the follow command as an example,

```
make directed_tests.texture.hipTexObjPitch
cd $HIPAMD_DIR/build/directed_tests/texcture
./hipTexObjPitch
```
Please note, the integrated HIP directed tests, will be deprecated in future release.


### Build HIP catch tests

HIP catch tests, with new architectured Catch2, are official seperated from HIP project, exist in HIP tests repository, can be built via the following instructions.

#### Get HIP tests source code

```
git clone -b "$ROCM_BRANCH" https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hip-tests.git
```
#### Build HIP tests from source

```
export HIP_TESTS_DIR="$(readlink -f hip-tests)"
cd "$HIP_TESTS_DIR"
mkdir -p build; cd build
export HIP_PATH=$HIPAMD_DIR/build/install (or any path where HIP is installed, for example, /opt/rocm)
cmake ../catch/ -DHIP_PLATFORM=amd
make -j$(nproc) build_tests
ctest # run tests
```
HIP catch tests are built under the folder $HIP_TESTS_DIR/build.

To run any single catch test, the following is an example,

```
cd $HIP_TESTS_DIR/build/catch_tests/unit/texture
./TextureTest
```

#### Build HIP Catch2 standalone test

HIP Catch2 supports build a standalone test, for example,

```
cd "$HIP_TESTS_DIR"
hipcc $HIP_TESTS_DIR/catch/unit/memory/hipPointerGetAttributes.cc -I ./catch/include ./catch/hipTestMain/standalone_main.cc -I ./catch/external/Catch2 -o hipPointerGetAttributes
./hipPointerGetAttributes
...

All tests passed
```

# Build HIP on NVIDIA platform


## Get HIP source code

```
git clone -b "$ROCM_BRANCH" https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hip.git
git clone -b "$ROCM_BRANCH" https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hipamd.git
```

## Set the environment variables

```
export HIP_DIR="$(readlink -f hip)"
export HIPAMD_DIR="$(readlink -f hipamd)"
```

## Build HIP

```
cd "$HIPAMD_DIR"
mkdir -p build; cd build
cmake -DHIP_COMMON_DIR=$HIP_DIR -DHIP_PLATFORM=nvidia -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/install ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

## Build HIP tests
Build HIP tests commands on NVIDIA platform are basically the same as AMD, except set -DHIP_PLATFORM=nvidia.

# Run HIP

Compile and run the [square sample](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/tree/rocm-5.0.x/samples/0_Intro/square).
