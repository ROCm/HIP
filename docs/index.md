# HIP documentation

The Heterogeneous-computing Interface for Portability (HIP) API is a C++ runtime
API and kernel language that lets developers create portable applications for AMD
and NVIDIA GPUs from single source code.

For HIP supported AMD GPUs on multiple operating systems, see:

* [Linux system requirements](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#supported-gpus)
* [Microsoft Windows system requirements](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-windows/en/latest/reference/system-requirements.html#windows-supported-gpus)

The CUDA enabled NVIDIA GPUs are supported by HIP. For more information, see [GPU Compute Capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).

On the AMD ROCm platform, HIP provides header files and runtime library built on top of HIP-Clang compiler in the repository [Common Language Runtime (CLR)](./understand/amd_clr), which contains source codes for AMD's compute languages runtimes as follows,

On non-AMD platforms, like NVIDIA, HIP provides header files required to support non-AMD specific back-end implementation in the repository ['hipother'](https://github.com/ROCm/hipother), which translates from the HIP runtime APIs to CUDA runtime APIs.
