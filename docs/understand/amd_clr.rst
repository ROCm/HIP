*******************************************************************************
AMD common language runtimes (CLR)
*******************************************************************************

CLR contains source codes for AMD's compute languages runtimes: ``HIP`` and ``OpenCL™``.
CLR is the part of HIP runtime which is supported on the AMD ROCm platform, it provides a header and runtime library built on top of HIP-Clang compiler.
For developers and users, CLR implements HIP runtime APIs including streams, events, and memory APIs, which is a object library that is linked with the application.
The source codes for all headers and the library implementation are available on GitHub in the `CLR repository <https://github.com/ROCm/clr>`_.


Project organization
====================

CLR includes the following source code,

* ``hipamd`` - contains implementation of ``HIP`` language on the AMD platform. It is hosted at `clr/hipamd <https://github.com/ROCm/clr/tree/develop/hipamd>`_.

* ``opencl`` - contains implementation of `OpenCL™ <https://www.khronos.org/opencl/>`_ on AMD platform. It is hosted at `clr/opencl <https://github.com/ROCm/clr/tree/develop/opencl>`_.

* ``rocclr`` - contains common runtime used in `HIP` and `OpenCL™`. This is hosted at `clr/rocclr <https://github.com/ROCm/clr/tree/develop/rocclr>`_.


How to build/install
====================

Prerequisites
-------------

Please refer to Quick Start Guide in `ROCm Docs <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/tutorial/quick-start.html>`_.

Building CLR requires ``rocm-hip-libraries`` meta package, which provides the pre-requisites for CLR.


Linux
-----

* Clone this repository

.. code-block:: shell

   cd clr && mkdir build && cd build

* For ``HIP``

.. code-block:: shell

   cmake .. -DCLR_BUILD_HIP=ON -DHIP_COMMON_DIR=$HIP_COMMON_DIR

   ``HIP_COMMON_DIR`` points to `HIP <https://github.com/ROCm/HIP>`_.

* For ``OpenCL™``

.. code-block:: shell

   cmake .. -DCLR_BUILD_OCL=ON
   make
   make install


Users can also build ``OCL`` and ``HIP`` at the same time by passing ``-DCLR_BUILD_HIP=ON -DCLR_BUILD_OCL=ON`` to configure command.

For detail instructions, please refer to `build HIP <https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/install/build.html>`_.


Test
-----

``hip-tests`` is a separate repository hosted at `hip-tests <https://github.com/ROCm/hip-tests>`_.

To run ``hip-tests`` please go to the repository and follow the steps.


Release notes
-------------

HIP provides release notes in CLR `change log <https://github.com/ROCm/clr/blob/develop/CHANGELOG.md>`_, which has records of changes in each release.
