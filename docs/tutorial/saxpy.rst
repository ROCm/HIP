*******************************************************************************
SAXPY - Hello, HIP
*******************************************************************************

This tutorial explains the basic concepts of the single-source
Heterogeneous-computing Interface for Portability (HIP) programming model and
the essential tooling around it. It also reviews some commonalities of
heterogenous APIs in general. This topic assumes basic familiarity with the
C/C++ compilation model and language.

Prerequisites
=============

To follow this tutorial, you'll need installed drivers and a HIP compiler
toolchain to compile your code. Because HIP for ROCm supports compiling and
running on Linux and Windows with AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, the combination of
install instructions is more than worth covering as part of this tutorial. For
more information about installing HIP development packages, see
:doc:`/install/install`.

.. _hip-tutorial-saxpy-heterogeneous-programming:

Heterogeneous programming
=========================

*Heterogeneous programming* and *offloading APIs* are often mentioned together. Heterogeneous programming deals with devices of varying capabilities simultaneously. Offloading focuses on the "remote" and asynchronous aspects of computation. HIP encompasses both. It exposes GPGPU (general-purpose GPU) programming much like ordinary host-side CPU programming and lets you move data across various devices.

When programming in HIP (and other heterogenous APIs for that matter), remember that target devices are built for a specific purpose. They are designed with different tradeoffs than traditional CPUs and therefore have very different performance characteristics. Even subtle changes in code might adversely affect execution time.

Your first lines of HIP code
============================

First, let's do the "Hello, World!" of GPGPU: SAXPY. Single-precision A times X Plus Y (*SAXPY*) is a mathematical acronym; a vector equation :math:`a\cdot x+y=z` where :math:`a\in\mathbb{R}` is a scalar and :math:`x,y,z\in\mathbb{V}` are vector quantities of some large dimensionality. This vector space is defined over the set of reals. Practically speaking, you can compute this using a single ``for`` loop over three arrays.

.. code-block:: C++

    for (int i = 0 ; i < N ; ++i)
        z[i] = a * x[i] + y[i];

In linear algebra libraries, such as BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subsystem) this operation is defined as AXPY "A times X Plus Y". The "S" comes from *single-precision*, meaning that array element is ``float`` -s (IEEE 754 binary32 representation).

To quickly get started, use the set of `HIP samples from GitHub <https://github.com/amd/rocm-examples/>`_. With Git configured on your machine, open a command-line and navigate to your desired working directory, then run:

.. code-block:: shell

  git clone https://github.com/amd/rocm-examples.git

A simple implementation of SAXPY resides in the ``HIP-Basic/saxpy/main.hip`` file in this repository. The HIP code here mostly deals with where data has to be and when, and how devices transform this data. The first HIP calls deal with allocating device-side memory and copying data from host-side memory to device side in a C runtime-like fashion.

.. code-block:: C++

  // Allocate and copy vectors to device memory.
  float* d_x{};
  float* d_y{};
  HIP_CHECK(hipMalloc(&d_x, size_bytes));
  HIP_CHECK(hipMalloc(&d_y, size_bytes));
  HIP_CHECK(hipMemcpy(d_x, x.data(), size_bytes, hipMemcpyHostToDevice));
  HIP_CHECK(hipMemcpy(d_y, y.data(), size_bytes, hipMemcpyHostToDevice));

``HIP_CHECK`` is a custom macro borrowed from the examples utilities which checks the error code returned by API functions for errors and reports them to the console. It is not essential to the API, but it is a good practice to check the error codes of the HIP APIs in case you pass on incorrect values to the API, or the API might be out of resources.

The code selects the device to allocate to and to copy to. Commands are issued to the HIP runtime per thread, and every thread has a device set as the target of commands. The default device is ``0``, which is equivalent to calling ``hipSetDevice(0)``.

Launch the calculation on the device after the input data has been prepared.

.. code-block:: C++

  __global__ void saxpy_kernel(const float a, const float* d_x, float* d_y, const unsigned int size)
  {
      // ...
  }

  int main()
  {
      // ...

      // Launch the kernel on the default stream.
      saxpy_kernel<<<dim3(grid_size), dim3(block_size), 0, hipStreamDefault>>>(a, d_x, d_y, size);
  }

Analyze at the signature of the offloaded function:

- ``__global__`` instructs the compiler to generate code for this function as an
  entrypoint to a device program, such that it can be launched from the host.
- The function does not return anything, because there is no trivial way to
  construct a return channel of a parallel invocation. Device-side entrypoints
  may not return a value, their results should be communicated using output
  parameters.
- Device-side functions are typically called compute kernels, or just kernels
  for short. This is to distinguish them from non-graphics-related graphics
  shaders, or just shaders for short.
- Arguments are taken by value and all arguments shall be
  `TriviallyCopyable <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/TriviallyCopyable>`_,
  meaning they should be `memcpy`-friendly. (Imagine if they had custom copy
  constructors. Where would that logic execute? On the host? On the device?)
  Pointer arguments are pointers to device memory, one typically backed by
  VRAM.
- We said that we'll be computing :math:`a\cdot x+y=z`, however we only pass
  two pointers to the function. We'll be canonically reusing one of the inputs
  as outputs.

This function is launched from the host using a language extension often called
the triple chevron syntax. Inside the angle brackets, provide the following.

- The number of :ref:`blocks <inherent_thread_hierarchy_block>` to launch (our :ref:`grid <inherent_thread_hierarchy_grid>` size)
- The number of threads in a :ref:`block <inherent_thread_hierarchy_block>` (our :ref:`block <inherent_thread_hierarchy_block>` size)
- The amount of shared memory to allocate by the host
- The device stream to enqueue the operation on

The :ref:`block <inherent_thread_hierarchy_block>` size and shared memory become important later in :doc:`reduction`. For
now, a hardcoded ``256`` is a safe default for simple kernels such as this.
Following the triple chevron is ordinary function argument passing.

Look at how the kernel is implemented.

.. code-block:: C++

  __global__ void saxpy_kernel(const float a, const float* d_x, float* d_y, const unsigned int size)
  {
      // Compute the current thread's index in the grid.
      const unsigned int global_idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;

      // The grid can be larger than the number of items in the vectors. Avoid out-of-bounds addressing.
      if(global_idx < size)
      {
          d_y[global_idx] = a * d_x[global_idx] + d_y[global_idx];
      }
  }

- The unique linear index identifying the thread is computed from the :ref:`block <inherent_thread_hierarchy_block>` ID
  the thread is a member of, the :ref:`block <inherent_thread_hierarchy_block>`'s size and the ID of the thread within
  the :ref:`block <inherent_thread_hierarchy_block>`.
- A check is made to avoid overindexing the input.
- The useful part of the computation is carried out.

Retrieval of the result from the device is done much like input data copy. In this current step the results copied from device to host. The opposite direction of the input data copy:

.. code-block:: C++

  HIP_CHECK(hipMemcpy(y.data(), d_y, size_bytes, hipMemcpyDeviceToHost));

Compiling on the command line
=============================

.. _setting_up_the_command-line:

Setting up the command line
---------------------------

Strictly speaking there's no such thing as "setting up the command-line
for compilation" on Linux. To make invocations more terse, Linux and Windows
example follow.

.. tab-set::
  .. tab-item:: Linux and AMD
    :sync: linux-amd

    While distro maintainers might package ROCm so that it installs to
    system-default locations, AMD's packages don't install that way. They need
    to be added to the PATH by the user.

    .. code-block:: bash

      export PATH=/opt/rocm/bin:${PATH}

    You should be able to call the compiler on the command line now:

    .. code-block:: bash

      amdclang++ --version

    .. note::

      Docker images distributed by AMD, such as
      `rocm-terminal <https://hub.docker.com/r/rocm/rocm-terminal/>`_ already
      have `/opt/rocm/bin` on the Path for convenience. This subtly affects
      CMake package detection logic of ROCm libraries.

  .. tab-item:: Linux and NVIDIA
    :sync: linux-nvidia

    Both distro maintainers and NVIDIA package CUDA so that ``nvcc`` and related
    tools are available on the command line by default. You can call the
    compiler on the command line with:

    .. code-block:: bash

      nvcc --version

  .. tab-item:: Windows and AMD
    :sync: windows-amd

    Windows compilers and command line tooling have traditionally relied on
    extra environmental variables and PATH entries to function correctly.
    Visual Studio refers to command lines with this setup as "Developer
    Command Prompt" or "Developer PowerShell" for ``cmd.exe`` and PowerShell
    respectively.

    The HIP SDK on Windows doesn't include a complete toolchain. You will also
    need:

    - The Microsoft Windows SDK. It provides the import libs to crucial system
      libraries that all executables must link to and some auxiliary compiler
      tooling.
    - A Standard Template Library (STL). Installed as part of the Microsoft
      Visual C++ compiler (MSVC) or with Visual Studio.

    If you don't have a version of Visual Studio 2022 installed, for a
    minimal command line experience, install the
    `Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022 <https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe>`_
    with the Desktop Developemnt Workload. Under Individual Components select:

    - A version of the Windows SDK
    - "MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest)"
    - "C++ CMake tools for Windows" (optional)

    .. note::

      The "C++ CMake tools for Windows" individual component is a convenience which
      puts both ``cmake.exe`` and ``ninja.exe`` onto the PATH inside developer
      command prompts. You can install these manually, but then you must manage
      them manually.

    Visual Studio 2017 and later are detectable as COM object instances via WMI.
    To setup a command line from any shell for the latest Visual Studio's
    default Visual C++ toolset issue:

    .. code-block:: powershell

      $InstallationPath = Get-CimInstance MSFT_VSInstance | Sort-Object -Property Version -Descending | Select-Object -First 1 -ExpandProperty InstallLocation
      Import-Module $InstallationPath\Common7\Tools\Microsoft.VisualStudio.DevShell.dll
      Enter-VsDevShell -InstallPath $InstallationPath -SkipAutomaticLocation -Arch amd64 -HostArch amd64 -DevCmdArguments '-no_logo'
      $env:PATH = "${env:HIP_PATH}bin;${env:PATH}"

    You should be able to call the compiler on the command line now:

    .. code-block:: powershell

      clang++ --version

  .. tab-item:: Windows and NVIDIA
    :sync: windows-nvidia

    Windows compilers and command line tooling have traditionally relied on
    extra environmental variables and PATH entries to function correctly.
    Visual Studio refers to command lines with this setup as "Developer
    Command Prompt" or "Developer PowerShell" for ``cmd.exe`` and PowerShell
    respectively.

    The HIP and CUDA SDKs on Windows don't include complete toolchains. You will
    also need:

    - The Microsoft Windows SDK. It provides the import libs to crucial system
      libraries that all executables must link to and some auxiliary compiler
      tooling.
    - A Standard Template Library (STL). Installed as part of the Microsoft
      Visual C++ compiler (MSVC) or with Visual Studio.

    If you don't have a version of Visual Studio 2022 installed, for a
    minimal command line experience, install the
    `Build Tools for Visual Studio 2022 <https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe>`_
    with the Desktop Developemnt Workload. Under Individual Components select:

    - A version of the Windows SDK
    - "MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest)"
    - "C++ CMake tools for Windows" (optional)

    .. note::

      The "C++ CMake tools for Windows" individual component is a convenience which
      puts both ``cmake.exe`` and ``ninja.exe`` onto the PATH inside developer
      command prompts. You can install these manually, but then you must manage
      them manually.

    .. code-block:: powershell

      Import-Module $InstallationPath\Common7\Tools\Microsoft.VisualStudio.DevShell.dll
      Enter-VsDevShell -InstallPath $InstallationPath -SkipAutomaticLocation -Arch amd64 -HostArch amd64 -DevCmdArguments '-no_logo'

    You should be able to call the compiler on the command line now:

    .. code-block:: powershell

      nvcc --version

Invoking the compiler manually
------------------------------

To compile and link a single-file application, use the following commands:

.. tab-set::
  .. tab-item:: Linux and AMD
    :sync: linux-amd

    .. code-block:: bash

      amdclang++ ./HIP-Basic/saxpy/main.hip -o saxpy -I ./Common -lamdhip64 -L /opt/rocm/lib -O2

  .. tab-item:: Linux and NVIDIA
    :sync: linux-nvidia

    .. code-block:: bash

      nvcc ./HIP-Basic/saxpy/main.hip -o saxpy -I ./Common -I /opt/rocm/include -O2 -x cu

  .. tab-item:: Windows and AMD
    :sync: windows-amd

    .. code-block:: powershell

      clang++ .\HIP-Basic\saxpy\main.hip -o saxpy.exe -I .\Common -lamdhip64 -L ${env:HIP_PATH}lib -O2

  .. tab-item:: Windows and NVIDIA
    :sync: windows-nvidia

    .. code-block:: powershell

      nvcc .\HIP-Basic\saxpy\main.hip -o saxpy.exe -I ${env:HIP_PATH}include -I .\Common -O2 -x cu

Depending on your computer, the resulting binary might or might not run. If not,
it typically complains about "Invalid device function". That error
(corresponding to the ``hipErrorInvalidDeviceFunction`` entry of ``hipError_t``)
means that the runtime could not find a device program binary of the
appropriate flavor embedded into the executable.

So far, the discussion has covered how data makes it from the host to the
device and back. It has also discussed the device code as source, with the HIP
runtime arguing that the correct binary to dispatch for execution. How can you
find out what device binary flavors are embedded into the executable?

.. tab-set::

  .. tab-item:: Linux and AMD
    :sync: linux-amd

    The utilities included with ROCm help significantly to inspect binary
    artifacts on disk. Add the ROCmCC installation folder to your PATH if you
    want to use these utilities (the utilities expect them to be on the PATH).

    You can list embedded program binaries using ``roc-obj-ls``.

    .. code-block:: bash

      roc-obj-ls ./saxpy

    It should return something like:

    .. code-block:: shell

      1       host-x86_64-unknown-linux         file://./saxpy#offset=12288&size=0
      1       hipv4-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx803   file://./saxpy#offset=12288&size=9760

    The compiler embeds a version 4 code object (more on `code
    object versions <https://www.llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#code-object-metadata>`_)
    and used the LLVM target triple `amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx803` (more on `target triples
    <https://www.llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#target-triples>`_). You can
    extract that program object in a disassembled fashion for human consumption
    via ``roc-obj``.

    .. code-block:: bash

      roc-obj -t gfx803 -d ./saxpy

    This creates two files on disk and ``.s`` extension is of most interest.
    Opening this file or dumping it to the console using ``cat``
    lets find the disassembled binary of the SAXPY compute kernel, something
    similar to:

    .. code-block::

      Disassembly of section .text:

          s_endpgm                             // 000000001088: BF810000

    Alternatively, call the compiler with ``--save-temps`` to dump all device
    binary to disk in separate files.

    .. code-block:: bash

      amdclang++ ./HIP-Basic/saxpy/main.hip -o saxpy -I ./Common -lamdhip64 -L /opt/rocm/lib -O2 --save-temps

    List all the temporaries created while compiling ``main.hip`` with:

    .. code-block:: bash

      ls main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-*
      main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx803.bc
      main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx803.cui
      main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx803.o
      main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx803.out
      main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx803.out.resolution.txt
      main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx803.s

    Files with the ``.s`` extension hold the disassembled contents of the binary.
    The filename notes the graphics IPs used by the compiler. The contents of
    this file are similar to what ``roc-obj`` printed to the console.

  .. tab-item:: Linux and NVIDIA
    :sync: linux-nvidia

    Unlike HIP on AMD, when compiling using the NVIDIA support of HIP the resulting
    binary will be a valid CUDA executable as far as the binary goes. Therefor
    it'll incorporate PTX ISA (Parallel Thread eXecution Instruction Set
    Architecture) instead of AMDGPU binary. As s result, tooling shipping with the
    CUDA SDK can be used to inspect which device ISA got compiled into a specific
    executable. The tool most useful to us currently is ``cuobjdump``.

    .. code-block:: bash

      cuobjdump --list-ptx ./saxpy

    Which will print something like:

    .. code-block::

      PTX file    1: saxpy.1.sm_52.ptx

    From this we can see that the saxpy kernel is stored as ``sm_52``, which shows
    that a compute capability 5.2 ISA got embedded into the executable, so devices
    which sport compute capability 5.2 or newer will be able to run this code.

  .. tab-item:: Windows and AMD
    :sync: windows-amd

    The HIP SDK for Windows don't yet sport the ``roc-*`` set of utilities to work
    with binary artifacts. To find out what binary formats are embedded into an
    executable, one may use ``dumpbin`` tool from the Windows SDK to obtain the
    raw data of the ``.hip_fat`` section of an executable. (This binary payload is
    what gets parsed by the ``roc-*`` set of utilities on Linux.) Skipping over the
    reported header, the rendered raw data as ASCII has ~3 lines per entries.
    Depending on how many binaries are embedded, you may need to alter the number
    of rendered lines. An invocation such as:

    .. code-block:: powershell

      dumpbin.exe /nologo /section:.hip_fat /rawdata:8 .\saxpy.exe | select -Skip 20 -First 12

    The output may look like:

    .. code-block::

    We can see that the compiler embedded a version 4 code object (more on code
    `object versions <https://www.llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#code-object-metadata>`_) and
    used the LLVM target triple `amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx906` (more on `target triples
    <https://www.llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#target-triples>`_). Don't be
    alarmed about linux showing up as a binary format, AMDGPU binaries uploaded to
    the GPU for execution are proper linux ELF binaries in their format.

    Alternatively we can call the compiler with ``--save-temps`` to dump all device
    binary to disk in separate files.

    .. code-block:: powershell

      clang++ .\HIP-Basic\saxpy\main.hip -o saxpy.exe -I .\Common -lamdhip64 -L ${env:HIP_PATH}lib -O2 --save-temps

    Now we can list all the temporaries created while compiling ``main.hip`` via

    .. code-block:: powershell

      Get-ChildItem -Filter main-hip-* | select -Property Name

      Name
      ----
      main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx906.bc
      main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx906.hipi
      main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx906.o
      main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx906.out
      main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx906.out.resolution.txt
      main-hip-amdgcn-amd-amdhsa-gfx906.s

    Files with the ``.s`` extension hold the disassembled contents of the binary and
    the filename directly informs us of the graphics IPs used by the compiler.

    Unlike HIP on AMD, when compiling using the NVIDIA support for HIP, the resulting
    binary will be a valid CUDA executable. Therefore, it'll incorporate PTX ISA
    (Parallel Thread eXecution Instruction Set Architecture) instead of AMDGPU
    binary. As a result, tooling included with the CUDA SDK can be used to
    inspect which device ISA was compiled into a specific executable. The most
    helpful to us currently is ``cuobjdump``.

    .. code-block:: bash

      cuobjdump.exe --list-ptx .\saxpy.exe

    Which prints something like:

    .. code-block::

      PTX file    1: saxpy.1.sm_52.ptx

    This example shows that the SAXPY kernel is stored as ``sm_52``. It also shows
    that a compute capability 5.2 ISA was embedded into the executable, so devices
    that support compute capability 5.2 or newer will be able to run this code.

Now that you've found what binary got embedded into the executable, find which
format our available devices use.

    On Linux a utility called ``rocminfo`` helps us list all the properties of the
    devices available on the system, including which version of graphics IP
    (``gfxXYZ``) they employ. You can filter the output to have only these lines:

    .. code-block:: bash

      /opt/rocm/bin/rocminfo | grep gfx
        Name:                    gfx906
            Name:                    amdgcn-amd-amdhsa--gfx906:sramecc+:xnack-

    Now that you know which graphics IPs our devices use, recompile your program with
    the appropriate parameters.

    .. code-block:: bash

      amdclang++ ./HIP-Basic/saxpy/main.hip -o saxpy -I ./Common -lamdhip64 -L /opt/rocm/lib -O2 --offload-arch=gfx906:sramecc+:xnack-

    Now the sample will run.

    .. code-block::

      Calculating y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i] over 1000000 elements.
      First 10 elements of the results: [ 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21 ]

    On Linux HIP with the NVIDIA back-end, the ``deviceQuery`` CUDA SDK sample
    can help us list all the properties of the devices available on the system,
    including which version of compute capability a device sports.
    ``<major>.<minor>`` compute capability is passed to ``nvcc`` on the
    command-line as ``sm_<major><minor>``, for eg. ``8.6`` is ``sm_86``.

    Because it's not included as a binary, compile the matching
    example from ROCm.

    .. code-block:: bash

      nvcc ./HIP-Basic/device_query/main.cpp -o device_query -I ./Common -I /opt/rocm/include -O2

    Filter the output to have only the lines of interest, for example:

    .. code-block:: bash

      ./device_query | grep "major.minor"
      major.minor:              8.6
      major.minor:              7.0

    .. note::

      In addition to the ``nvcc`` executable is another tool called ``__nvcc_device_query``
      which prints the SM Architecture numbers to standard out as a comma
      separated list of numbers. The utility's name suggests it's not a user-facing
      executable but is used by ``nvcc`` to determine what devices are in the
      system at hand.

    Now that you know which graphics IPs our devices use, recompile your program with
    the appropriate parameters.

    .. code-block:: bash

      nvcc ./HIP-Basic/saxpy/main.hip -o saxpy -I ./Common -I /opt/rocm/include -O2 -x cu -arch=sm_70,sm_86

    .. note::

      If you want to portably target the development machine which is compiling, you
      may specify ``-arch=native`` instead.

    Now the sample will run.

    .. code-block::

      ./saxpy
      Calculating y[i] = a * x[i] + y[i] over 1000000 elements.

    On Windows, a utility called ``hipInfo.exe`` helps us list all the properties
    of the devices available on the system, including which version of graphics IP
    (``gfxXYZ``) they employ. Filter the output to have only these lines:

    .. code-block:: powershell

      gcnArchName:                      gfx1032
      gcnArchName:                      gfx1035

    Now that you know which graphics IPs our devices use, recompile your program with
