Memory management
********************************************************************************

Memory management is an important part of the HIP runtime API, when creating
high-performance applications. Both allocating and copying memory can result in
bottlenecks, which can significantly impact performance.

The programming model is based on a system with a host and a device, each having
its own distinct memory. Kernels operate on :ref:`device_memory`, while host functions
operate on :ref:`host_memory`.

The runtime offers functions for allocating, freeing, and copying device memory,
along with transferring data between host and device memory.

Here are the various memory management techniques:

* :ref:`coherence_control`
* :ref:`unified_memory`
* :ref:`virtual_memory`
* :ref:`stream_ordered_memory_allocator_how-to`
