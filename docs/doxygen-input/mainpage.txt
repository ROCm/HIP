 * @mainpage Heterogeneous-computing Interface for Portability (HIP)
 * @tableofcontents
 *
 * The HIP interface makes it very easy to port existing CUDA apps to run on AMD GPUs,
 * or to develop new apps that can run on either CUDA or AMD GPUs from a common source base.
 *
 *  - HIP is very thin and has little or no performance impact over coding directly in CUDA NVCC or HCC HC mode.
 *  - HIP allows developers to use the "best" development environment and tools on each target platform.
 *  - HIP allows coding in a single-source C++ programming language including features such as templates, C++11 lambdas,and more.
 *  - "hipify" tool automatically converts source from CUDA to HIP.
 *  - Developers can specialize for CUDA or HCC to tune for performance or handle tricky cases with #ifdef.

 *  - See the @ref API.
