# Installing pre-built packages

HIP can be easily installed using pre-built binary packages using the package manager for your platform.

## Prerequisites
HIP code can be developed either on AMD ROCm platform using HIP-Clang compiler, or a CUDA platform with nvcc installed.

## AMD Platform

```
sudo apt install mesa-common-dev
sudo apt install clang
sudo apt install comgr
sudo apt-get -y install rocm-dkms
```
Public link for Rocm installation
https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation-Guide.html 

HIP-Clang is the compiler for compiling HIP programs on AMD platform 

HIP-Clang can be built manually,
```
git clone https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.git
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/opt/rocm/llvm -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=1 -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="AMDGPU;X86" -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_LLD_SOURCE_DIR=../lld -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_CLANG_SOURCE_DIR=../clang ../llvm
make -j
sudo make install
```

Rocm device library can be manually built as following,
```
export PATH=/opt/rocm/llvm/bin:$PATH
git clone -b amd-stg-open https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm-Device-Libs.git
cd ROCm-Device-Libs
mkdir -p build && cd build
CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -DLLVM_DIR=/opt/rocm/llvm -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_WERROR=1 -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=1 ..
make -j
sudo make install
```

## NVIDIA Platform

HIP-nvcc is the compiler for HIP program compilation on NVIDIA platform.
 
* Add the ROCm package server to your system as per the OS-specific guide available [here](https://rocm.github.io/ROCmInstall.html#installing-from-amd-rocm-repositories).
* Install the "hip-nvcc" package.  This will install CUDA SDK and the HIP porting layer.
```
apt-get install hip-nvcc
```

* Default paths and environment variables:
   * By default HIP looks for CUDA SDK in /usr/local/cuda (can be overriden by setting CUDA_PATH env variable)
   * By default HIP is installed into /opt/rocm/hip (can be overridden by setting HIP_PATH environment variable).
   * Optionally, consider adding /opt/rocm/bin to your path to make it easier to use the tools.

# Building HIP from source 

## Build ROCclr

ROCclr is defined on AMD platform that HIP use Radeon Open Compute Common Language Runtime (ROCclr), which is a virtual device interface that HIP runtimes interact with different backends.
See https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/ROCclr

```
git clone -b roc-3.5.x https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/ROCclr.git
export ROCCLR_DIR="$(readlink -f ROCclr)"
git clone -b roc-3.5.x https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm-OpenCL-Runtime.git
export OPENCL_DIR="$(readlink -f ROCm-OpenCL-Runtime)"
cd "$ROCCLR_DIR"
mkdir -p build;cd build
cmake -DOPENCL_DIR="$OPENCL_DIR" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=</where/to/install/ROCclr> ..
make
sudo make install
```

## Build HIP

```
git clone -b roc-3.5.x https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP.git
export HIP_DIR="$(readlink -f HIP)"
cd "$HIP_DIR"
mkdir -p build; cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DHIP_COMPILER=clang -DHIP_PLATFORM=rocclr -DROCclr_DIR="$ROCCLR_DIR" -DLIBROCclr_STATIC_DIR="$ROCCLR_DIR/build" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=</where/to/install/hip> ..
make
sudo make install
```

## Default paths and environment variables

   * By default HIP looks for HSA in /opt/rocm/hsa (can be overridden by setting HSA_PATH environment variable).
   * By default HIP is installed into /opt/rocm/hip (can be overridden by setting HIP_PATH environment variable).
   * By default HIP looks for clang in /opt/rocm/llvm/bin (can be overridden by setting HIP_CLANG_PATH environment variable)
   * By default HIP looks for device library in /opt/rocm/lib (can be overriden by setting DEVICE_LIB_PATH environment variable).
   * Optionally, consider adding /opt/rocm/bin to your PATH to make it easier to use the tools.
   * Optionally, set HIPCC_VERBOSE=7 to output the command line for compilation.

After installation, make sure HIP_PATH is pointed to /where/to/install/hip

# Verify your installation

Run hipconfig (instructions below assume default installation path) :
```shell
/opt/rocm/bin/hipconfig --full
```
