# Installing pre-built packages

HIP can be easily installed using pre-built binary packages using the package manager for your platform.

## Prerequisites
HIP code can be developed either on AMD ROCm platform using HIP-Clang compiler, or a CUDA platform with nvcc installed.

## AMD Platform
ROCM_PATH is path where ROCM is installed. BY default ROCM_PATH is /opt/rocm.
```
sudo apt install mesa-common-dev
sudo apt install clang
sudo apt install comgr
sudo apt-get -y install rocm-dkms
```
Public link for Rocm installation
https://rocmdocs.amd.com/en/latest/Installation_Guide/Installation-Guide.html

HIP-Clang is the compiler for compiling HIP programs on AMD platform.

HIP-Clang can be built manually:
```
git clone -b amd-stg-open https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/llvm-project.git
cd llvm-project
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<ROCM_PATH>/llvm -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=1 -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="AMDGPU;X86" -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="clang;lld;compiler-rt" ../llvm
make -j
sudo make install
```
Rocm device library can be manually built as following,
```
export PATH=<ROCM_PATH>/llvm/bin:$PATH
git clone -b amd-stg-open https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm-Device-Libs.git
cd ROCm-Device-Libs
mkdir -p build && cd build
CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -DLLVM_DIR=<ROCM_PATH>/llvm -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DLLVM_ENABLE_WERROR=1 -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=1 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<ROCM_PATH> ..
make -j
sudo make install
```

## NVIDIA Platform

HIP-nvcc is the compiler for HIP program compilation on NVIDIA platform.

* Install Nvidia Driver
```
sudo apt-get install ubuntu-drivers-common && sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
sudo reboot
```
Or download the latest cuda-toolkit at https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads
The driver will be installed automatically.

* Add the ROCm package server to your system as per the OS-specific guide available [here](https://rocm.github.io/ROCmInstall.html#installing-from-amd-rocm-repositories).
* Install the "hip-runtime-nvidia" and "hip-dev" package.  This will install CUDA SDK and the HIP porting layer.
```
apt-get install hip-runtime-nvidia hip-dev
```
* Default paths and environment variables:
   * By default HIP looks for CUDA SDK in /usr/local/cuda (can be overriden by setting CUDA_PATH env variable).
   * By default HIP is installed into <ROCM_PATH>/hip (can be overridden by setting HIP_PATH environment variable).
   * Optionally, consider adding <ROCM_PATH>/bin to your path to make it easier to use the tools.


# Building HIP from source on AMD platform


## Get HIP source code

```
git clone -b develop https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hipamd.git
git clone -b develop https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hip.git
git clone -b develop https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/ROCclr.git
git clone -b develop https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm-OpenCL-Runtime.git
```

## Set the environment variables

```
export HIPAMD_DIR="$(readlink -f hipamd)"
export HIP_DIR="$(readlink -f hip)"
export ROCclr_DIR="$(readlink -f ROCclr)"
export OPENCL_DIR="$(readlink -f ROCm-OpenCL-Runtime)"
```

ROCclr is defined on AMD platform that HIP use Radeon Open Compute Common Language Runtime (ROCclr), which is a virtual device interface that HIP runtimes interact with different backends.
See https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/ROCclr

HIPAMD repository provides implementation specifically for AMD platform.
See https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hipamd

## Build HIP

```
cd "$HIPAMD_DIR"
mkdir -p build; cd build
cmake -DHIP_COMMON_DIR=$HIP_DIR -DAMD_OPENCL_PATH=$OPENCL_DIR -DROCCLR_PATH=$ROCCLR_DIR -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="<ROCM_PATH>/" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/install ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

Note: If you don't specify CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, hip runtime will be installed to "<ROCM_PATH>/hip".
By default, release version of AMDHIP is built.

## Default paths and environment variables

   * By default HIP looks for HSA in <ROCM_PATH>/hsa (can be overridden by setting HSA_PATH environment variable).
   * By default HIP is installed into <ROCM_PATH>/hip (can be overridden by setting HIP_PATH environment variable).
   * By default HIP looks for clang in <ROCM_PATH>/llvm/bin (can be overridden by setting HIP_CLANG_PATH environment variable)
   * By default HIP looks for device library in <ROCM_PATH>/lib (can be overridden by setting DEVICE_LIB_PATH environment variable).
   * Optionally, consider adding <ROCM_PATH>/bin to your PATH to make it easier to use the tools.
   * Optionally, set HIPCC_VERBOSE=7 to output the command line for compilation.

After installation, make sure HIP_PATH is pointed to /where/to/install/hip


# Building HIP from source on NVIDIA platform


## Get HIP source code

```
git clone -b develop https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hip.git
git clone -b develop https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hipamd.git
```

## Set the environment variables

```
export HIP_DIR="$(readlink -f hip)"
export HIPAMD_DIR="$(readlink -f hipamd)"
```

## Build HIP

```
cd "$HIPAMD_DIR"
mkdir -p build; cd build
cmake -DHIP_COMMON_DIR=$HIP_DIR -DHIP_PLATFORM=nvidia -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$PWD/install ..
make -j$(nproc)
sudo make install
```

# Verify your installation

Run hipconfig (instructions below assume default installation path) :
```shell
<ROCM_PATH>/bin/hipconfig --full
```
or

```shell
$PWD/install/bin/hipconfig --full
```

Compile and run the [square sample](https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/HIP/tree/rocm-4.5.x/samples/0_Intro/square).
