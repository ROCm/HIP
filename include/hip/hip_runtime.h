//! HIP = Heterogeneous-compute Interface for Portability
//!
//! Define a extremely thin runtime layer that allows source code to be compiled unmodified
//! through either AMD HCC or NVCC.   Key features tend to be in the spirit
//! and terminology of CUDA, but with a portable path to other accelerators as well:
//
//! Both paths support rich C++ features including classes, templates, lambdas, etc.
//! Runtime API is C
//! Memory management is based on pure pointers and resembles malloc/free/copy.
//
//! hip_runtime.h     : includes everything in hip_api.h, plus math builtins and kernel launch
//! macros. hip_runtime_api.h : Defines HIP API.  This is a C header file and does not use any C++
//! features.

#ifndef HIP_INCLUDE_HIP_HIP_RUNTIME_H

// Some standard header files, these are included by hc.hpp and so want to make them avail on both
// paths to provide a consistent include env and avoid "missing symbol" errors that only appears
// on NVCC path:
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <assert.h>
