## Using hipify-clang

`hipify-clang` is a clang-based tool which can automate the translation of CUDA source code into portable HIP C++.
The tool can automatically add extra HIP arguments (notably the "hipLaunchParm" required at the beginning of every HIP kernel call).
`hipify-clang` has some additional dependencies explained below and can be built as a separate make step. The instructions below are specifically for **Ubuntu 14.04** and **Ubuntu 16.04**.

### Build and install

- Download and unpack clang+llvm 3.8 binary package preqrequisite.

**Ubuntu 14.04**:
```shell
wget http://llvm.org/releases/3.8.0/clang+llvm-3.8.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-14.04.tar.xz
tar xvfJ clang+llvm-3.8.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-14.04.tar.xz
```
**Ubuntu 16.04**:
```shell
wget http://llvm.org/releases/3.8.0/clang+llvm-3.8.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-16.04.tar.xz
tar xvfJ clang+llvm-3.8.0-x86_64-linux-gnu-ubuntu-16.04.tar.xz
```

- Enable build of hipify-clang and specify path to LLVM.

Note HIPIFY_CLANG_LLVM_DIR must be a full absolute path to the location extracted above. Here's an example assuming we extract the clang 3.8 package into ~/HIP/clang+llvm-3.8.0/
```shell
cd HIP
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DHIPIFY_CLANG_LLVM_DIR=~/HIP/clang+llvm-3.8.0/ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
make install
```

### Running and using hipify-clang

`hipify-clang` performs an initial compile of the CUDA source code into a "symbol tree", and thus needs access to the appropriate header files.

In the case when `hipify-clang` doesn't find cuda headers, it reports various errors about unknown keywords (e.g. '\__global\__'), API function names (e.g. 'cudaMalloc'), syntax (e.g. 'foo<<<1,n>>>(...)'), etc.

To install CUDA headers, download the "deb(network)" variant of the target installer.

**Ubuntu 14.04**:
```shell
wget http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1404/x86_64/cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_7.5-18_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1404_7.5-18_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cuda-minimal-build-7-5 cuda-curand-dev-7-5
```
**Ubuntu 16.04**:
```shell
wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/multiverse/n/nvidia-cuda-toolkit/nvidia-cuda-toolkit_7.5.18-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i nvidia-cuda-toolkit_7.5.18-0ubuntu1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install cuda-minimal-build-7-5 cuda-curand-dev-7-5
```
To set additional options like Language Selection (only "-x cuda" is supported), Preprocessor Definition (-D), Include Path (-I), etc., options delimiter "--" should be used before them, for instance:

```shell
./hipify-clang -print-stats sort_kernel.cu -- -x cuda -I/srv/git/HIP/include -I/usr/local/cuda-7.5/include -DX=1
```

Delimiter "--" is used to separate hipify-clang options (before the delimiter) from clang options (after the delimiter). It is strongly recommended to always specify the delimiter, even if there are no clang specific options at all, in order to avoid possible errors regarding compilation database; in such case delimeter should be the last option in hipify-clang's command line.

Option "-x cuda" is also worth specifying in order to convert source CUDA files with extensions other than standard extensions (*.cu, *.cuh).
