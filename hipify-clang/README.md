## Build and install

### Dependencies

`hipify-clang` requires:
1. LLVM+CLANG of at least version 3.8.0, latest stable release is 6.0.0.
2. CUDA at least version 7.5, latest supported release is 9.0.

| **LLVM release version** | **CUDA latest supported version** |
|:------------------------:|:---------------------------------:|

In most cases, you can get a suitable version of LLVM+CLANG with your package manager.

Failing that or having multiple versions of LLVM, you can [download a release archive](http://releases.llvm.org/), build or install it, and set
[CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/variable/CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH.html) so `cmake` can find it; for instance: `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=f:\LLVM\6.0.0\dist`

### Build


Assuming this repository is at `./HIP`:

```shell
cd hipify-clang
mkdir build dist
cd build

cmake \
 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../dist \
 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
 ..

make -j install
```
On Windows the following option should be specified for `cmake` at first place: `-G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"` and after `cmake` the generated `hipify-clang.sln` should be built by `Visual Studio 15 2017` instead of `make`.

Debug build type `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` is also supported and tested, `LLVM+CLANG` should be built in `Debug` mode as well.
64 bit build mode `-Thost=x64` is supported as well, `LLVM+CLANG` should be built (installed) in 64bit mode as well.

The binary can then be found at `./dist/bin/hipify-clang`.

### Test

`hipify-clang` has unit tests using LLVM [`lit`](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/lit.html)/[`FileCheck`](https://llvm.org/docs/CommandGuide/FileCheck.html).

**LLVM+CLANG should be built from sources, Pre-Built Binaries are not exhaustive for testing.**

To run it:
1. Download [`LLVM`](http://releases.llvm.org/6.0.0/llvm-6.0.0.src.tar.xz)+[`CLANG`](http://releases.llvm.org/6.0.0/cfe-6.0.0.src.tar.xz) sources.
2. Build [`LLVM+CLANG`](http://llvm.org/docs/CMake.html).
    For instance:
    ```shell
   cd llvm
   mkdir build dist
   cd build

   cmake \
     -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../dist \
     -DLLVM_SOURCE_DIR=../llvm \
     -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
     -Thost=x64 \
     ../llvm

    make -j install
    ```
    On Windows the following option should be specified for `cmake` at first place: `-G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"` and after `cmake` the generated `LLVM.sln` should be built by `Visual Studio 15 2017` instead of `make`.

3. Ensure [`CUDA`](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit-archive) of minimum version 7.5 is installed.

    * Having multiple CUDA installations in order to choose a concrete version the `DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR` option should be specified:

      `-DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR="C:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v9.0"`

      * On Windows `CUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR` option should be specified as well:

      `-DCUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR="c:/ProgramData/NVIDIA Corporation/CUDA Samples/v9.0"`

4. Ensure [`cuDNN`](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive) of version corresponding to CUDA's version is installed.

    * Path to cuDNN should be specified by the `CUDA_DNN_ROOT_DIR` option:

      `-DCUDA_DNN_ROOT_DIR=f:/CUDNN/cudnn-9.0-windows10-x64-v7.1`

5. Ensure [`python`](https://www.python.org/downloads) of minimum required version 2.7 is installed.
6. Ensure `lit` and `FileCheck` are installed - these are distributed with LLVM.
    * installing `lit` into `python` might be required:

      `python f:/LLVM/6.0.0/llvm/utils/lit/setup.py install`,

      where `f:/LLVM/6.0.0/llvm` is LLVM sources root directory.

    * Starting with LLVM 6.0.0 path to llvm-lit.py script should be specified by the `LLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT` option:

      `-DLLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT=f:/LLVM/6.0.0/build/Debug/bin/llvm-lit.py`,

      where `f:/LLVM/6.0.0/build/Debug` is LLVM build directory.
7. Build with the `HIPIFY_CLANG_TESTS` option turned on: -DHIPIFY_CLANG_TESTS=1.
8. `make test-hipify`

    On Windows after `cmake` the project `test-hipify` in the generated `hipify-clang.sln` should be built by `Visual Studio 15 2017` instead of `make test-hipify`.

### Windows

On Windows the following tested configuration is recommended:

LLVM 6.0.0 (exact), CUDA 9.0 (exact), cudnn-9.0 (exact), Python 3.6 (min), cmake 3.10 (min), Visual Studio 15.5 2017 (min).

Here is an example of building `hipify-clang` with testing support on `Windows 10` by `Visual Studio 15 2017`:

```shell
cmake
 -G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64" \
 -DHIPIFY_CLANG_TESTS=1 \
 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
 -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../dist \
 -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=f:/LLVM/6.0.0/dist \
 -DCUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR="c:/Program Files/NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit/CUDA/v9.0" \
 -DCUDA_SDK_ROOT_DIR="c:/ProgramData/NVIDIA Corporation/CUDA Samples/v9.0" \
 -DCUDA_DNN_ROOT_DIR=f:/CUDNN/cudnn-9.0-windows10-x64-v7.1 \
 -DLLVM_EXTERNAL_LIT=f:/LLVM/6.0.0/build/Debug/bin/llvm-lit.py \
 ..
```
A corresponding successful output:
```shell
-- Found LLVM 6.0.0:
--    - CMake module path: F:/LLVM/6.0.0/dist/lib/cmake/llvm
--    - Include path     : F:/LLVM/6.0.0/dist/include
--    - Binary path      : F:/LLVM/6.0.0/dist/bin

```

## Running and using hipify-clang

To process a file, `hipify-clang` needs access to the same headers that would be needed to compile it with clang.

For example:

```shell
hipify-clang square.cu -- \
  -x cuda \
  --cuda-path=/opt/cuda \
  --cuda-gpu-arch=sm_30 \
  -isystem /opt/cuda/samples/common/inc
  -I /opt/cuda/cuDNN
```

`hipify-clang` arguments are given first, followed by a separator, and then the arguments you'd pass to `clang` if you
were compiling the input file. The [Clang manual for compiling CUDA](https://llvm.org/docs/CompileCudaWithLLVM.html#compiling-cuda-code)
may be useful.

For a list of `hipify-clang` options, run `hipify-clang --help`.
