## hip_add_executable ###
This tutorial shows how to use the FindHIP cmake module and create an executable using ```hip_add_executable``` macro.

## Including FindHIP cmake module in the project
Since FindHIP cmake module is not yet a part of the default cmake distribution, ```CMAKE_MODULE_PATH``` needs to be updated to contain the path to FindHIP.cmake.

The simplest approach is to use
```
set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "/opt/rocm/hip/cmake" ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH})
find_package(HIP)
```

A more generic solution that allows for a user specified location for the HIP installation would look something like
```
if(NOT DEFINED HIP_PATH)
    if(NOT DEFINED ENV{HIP_PATH})
        set(HIP_PATH "/opt/rocm/hip" CACHE PATH "Path to which HIP has been installed")
    else()
        set(HIP_PATH $ENV{HIP_PATH} CACHE PATH "Path to which HIP has been installed")
    endif()
endif()
set(CMAKE_MODULE_PATH "${HIP_PATH}/cmake" ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH})
find_package(HIP)
```

If your project already modifies ```CMAKE_MODULE_PATH```, you will need to append the path to FindHIP.cmake instead of replacing it.

## Using the hip_add_executable macro
FindHIP provides the ```hip_add_executable``` macro that is similar to the ```cuda_add_executable``` macro that is provided by FindCUDA.
The syntax is also similar. The ```hip_add_executable``` macro uses the hipcc wrapper as the compiler.
The macro supports specifying HCC-specific, NVCC-specific compiler options using the ```HCC_OPTIONS``` and ```NVCC_OPTIONS``` keywords.
Common options targeting both compilers can be specificed after the ```HIPCC_OPTIONS``` keyword. 

## How to build and run:
Use the following commands to build and execute the sample

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./MatrixTranspose
```
