// Simple test showing how to use HC syntax with AM (accelerator memory).
// AM provides a set of c-style memory management routines for allocating,
// freeing, and copying memory.   am_alloc returns a device pointer
// which can only be used on the device.  The programmer has full control
// over when data is copied.
