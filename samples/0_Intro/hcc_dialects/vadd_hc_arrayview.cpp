// Simple test showing how to use HC syntax with array_view.
// The code uses AMP's array_view class, which provides automatic data synchronization
// of data between the host and the accelerator. As noted below, the HCC runtime
// will automatically copy data to and from the host, without the user needing
// to manually perform such copies.  This is an excellent mode for developers
// new to GPU programming and matches the memory models provided by recent systems where
// CPU and GPU share the same memory pool.  Advanced programmers may prefer
// more explicit control over the data movement - shown in the other vadd_hc_array and
// vadd_hc_am examples.
// This example shows the similarity between C++AMP and and HC for simple cases where
// implicit data transfer is used - really the only difference is the namespace.
// Other examples show some of the more advanced controls.
